# ``JLPhotoLibrary``

Provides methods to requesting [Photo Library](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/photokit/phphotolibrary) permissions

## Overview

It would be required if your app wants to access camera or photo library.

## Topics

### Actions

#### ``$photolibrary.granted``
Returns `Promise.resolve(Bool)` if the permission is granted.

#### ``$photolibrary.authorize``
Returns `Promise.resolve(Int)` with the Authorization Status.

The returned number corresponds to [`PHAuthorizationStatus`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/photokit/phauthorizationstatus)

- _PHAuthorizationStatusNotDetermined_ = 0
User has not yet made a choice with regards to this application

- _PHAuthorizationStatusRestricted_ = 1

This application is not authorized to access photo data.
The user cannot change this applicationâ€™s status, possibly due to active restrictions
such as parental controls being in place.

- _PHAuthorizationStatusDenied_ = 2

User has explicitly denied this application access to photos data.

- _PHAuthorizationStatusAuthorized_ = 3

User has authorized this application to access photos data.

- _PHAuthorizationStatusLimited_ = 4

User has authorized this application for limited photo library access. Add _PHPhotoLibraryPreventAutomaticLimitedAccessAlert_ = YES to the application's Info.plist to prevent the automatic alert to update the users limited library selection.

### ``info.plist``

Add [NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/nsphotolibraryusagedescription) and [NSCameraUsageDescription](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/nscamerausagedescription) permissions to info.plist
