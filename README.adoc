_Jasonelle_ is a nice native wrapper for your Web Application.

## Price

The project requires purchasing a license if you want to:

- Use MPLv2 code.
- Execute in real hardware.

Please go to https://jasonelle.gumroad.com/ to purchase a license
and edit _Love.h_ to allow real device execution and _MPLv2_ licensed code.

If no license is purchased then the code is under _AGPLv3_. And will not execute
using real devices.

Since we cannot enforce this. We rely on your good heart. We trust you
are a kind person who will activate this mode ethically.
