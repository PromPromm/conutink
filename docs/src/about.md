| Monthly Payment Requirement | Single Payment
| Jasonelle's Membership Keys can be used in any amount of projects, as long as the subscription is maintained. | The license is tied to a single project
| The license expires if the membership is terminated | Thank you key licenses do not expire. That's why they are a little more expensive than the subscription.

Please go to [Jasonelle Store](https://jasonelle.gumroad.com/) to purchase a license
and edit _Love.h_ to allow real device execution and _MPLv2_ licensed code.

If no license is purchased then the code is under _AGPLv3_. And will not execute
using real devices.

Since we cannot enforce this. We rely on your good heart. We trust you
are a kind person who will activate this mode ethically.
