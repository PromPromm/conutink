and edit [**Love.h**](https://github.com/jasonelle/jasonelle/blob/main/sources/xcode/Jasonelle/Jasonelle/Jasonelle/Love.h) to allow real device execution and **MPLv2** licensed code.

If no license is purchased then the code is under **AGPLv3**. And will **not execute using real devices**. Although you can activate the full mode if you want to test if _Jasonelle_ is good for your use case (some features like _GPS_ need real hardware for testing).
